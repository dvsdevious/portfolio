                        <Text><p>I graduated from Chaifetz School of Business (Saint Louis University) with a B.S. in International Business.</p>
                            <p>After graduation, I worked as a Marketing and PR specialist for a TV and Radio broadcasting company. However, I eventually decided to leave my job and pursue a fitness project, where I helped my friend to develop her brand. As a social media manager and website developer, I wanted to create a unique fitness brand with a user-friendly interface and a fully functional platform where anyone can complete fitness workouts and achieve their goals. </p>
                            <p>As I started using website builder platforms like Wix and Tilda, I discovered that I wanted more control over the design and functionality of my websites. To achieve this, I decided to learn how to code and embarked on a continuous learning journey.</p>
                            <p>Through my studies with SheCodes, I completed four coding workshops and gained hands-on experience developing two website applications that utilized APIs. See credentials below â†“</p>
                            <p>I have over one year of experience as a Front-End Developer, specializing in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Throughout this time, I have honed my skills in creating engaging user interfaces, developing responsive designs, and building dynamic web applications.</p>
